# Statements

## 1. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They enable decision-making in your code, allowing it to behave differently under different circumstances.

### 1.1. `if` Statement
The `if` keyword in JavaScript is used to execute a block statement only if a specified condition is met.
<br>

Syntax:
```
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if condition is true
}
```
<br>

Example:
```
let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("User is an adult"); // Executed because (20 >= 18) returns true
}
```
<br>

### 1.2. `else` Statement
The `else` keyword in JavaScript is used in conjunction with an `if` keyword to execute a block statement if the condition in the `if` statement is not met.

Syntax:
```
if (condition){
    // Code to be executed if condition is true
} else{
    // Code to be executed if condition is false
}

```
<br>

Example:
```
let age = 11;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("User is an adult"); // Not Executed
} else{
    console.log("User is not an adult"); // Executed
}
```
<br>

### 1.3. `else if` Statement
The `else if` keyword in JavaScript is used to specify a new condition to test if the previous `if` or `else if` condition was false. It allows you to chain multiple conditions together, providing more complex decision-making capabilities.

Syntax:
```
if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true.
} else {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is false
}

```
<br>

Example:
```
let age = 12;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("User is an adult"); // Not Executed
} else if (age >= 12 && age <= 18){
    console.log("User is a teenager"); // Executed because expression is true
} else {
    console.log("User is not a teenager and adult"); // Not Executed
}
```
<br>

### 1.4. `break` Statement
The `break` keyword is used to exit loops and `switch` statements.
<br>

Example:
```


const fruit = "Apple";

switch (fruit) {
    case "Apple":
        console.log("Apple is healthy for our body");

    case "Mango":
        console.log("Mango is a National fruit of India");
        break;

    default:
        console.log("I don't like fruits.");
}
```
Output:
```
Apple is healthy for our body
Mango is a National fruits of India
```

`case "Mango"` is executed because `case "Apple"` do not have `break` statement.
<br>

### 1.5. `switch`, `case` & `default` Statement
The `switch` keyword takes in an argument and check against different conditions that are defined after the `case` keyword. If non of the conditions are met, statements under the `default` keyword will be executed. The `switch` is preferable over the `if...else` keyword when there is a need of comparing a single variable against multiple discrete values.

> **Note:** Switch & Case does not support logical operators.

<br>

Syntax:
```
switch (argument) {
    case condition1:
        // Code to be executed if condition1 is met
    case condition2:
        // Code to be executed if condition2 is met
}

```
<br>

Example 1:
```
switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("Start of the work week");
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        console.log("Second day of the work week");
        break;
    case "Wednesday":
        console.log("Midweek");
        break;
    case "Thursday":
        console.log("Almost the weekend");
        break;
    case "Friday":
        console.log("Last work day of the week");
        break;
    case "Saturday":
    case "Sunday":
        console.log("Weekend");
        break;

    default:
        console.log("Invalid day");
}
```
Example 2:

```
const marks = 85;

let Branch;

switch (true) {
    case marks >= 90:
        Branch = "Computer science engineering";
        break;
    case marks >= 80:
        Branch = "Mechanical engineering";
        break;
    case marks >= 70:
        Branch = "Chemical engineering";
        break;
    case marks >= 60:
        Branch = "Electronics and communication";
        break;
    case marks >= 50:
        Branch = "Civil engineering";
        break;
    default:
        Branch = "Bio technology";
        break;
}
```
<br>

### 1.6. Ternary Operator <code>?:</code>
Ternary operator is a shortcut for expressing conditional statement in Javascript.
<br>
Syntax:
```
(condition) ? // Statement to be executed if condition is true : // Statement to be executed if condition is false
```
Example:
```
(age >= 18) ? console.log("User is an adult") : console.log("User is not an adult");
```
<br>

### 1.7. `try...catch...finally` Statement
